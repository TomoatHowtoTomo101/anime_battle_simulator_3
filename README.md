# anime_battle_simulator_3

Hey! If you're wondering what the heck this is, it's a basic Unity thing that may or may not be the correct Unity engine, complete with all my crappy UI assets and Photoshop PSDs.

It's actually been so long that I don't remember which Unity version this thing was compiled on

All models in this extremely rudimentary build, as in the game isn't even.. A GAME yet.. might not even work, or are placeholders. Ths is entirely for the ABS3 development team.

If you want to join the ABS3 development team, just join via this Discord link and fill out a few forms:

# (For developers)

I probably never really mentioned anything about what is required to access a lot of the assets, so, well, I'll explain a bit.

PSD files are pretty much Photoshop files, and can usually be opened with such. But, in the case that ya don't have the software required, I'll be absolutely happy to update the repository with the raw concept files to save some time.

Well, when it's not something easily replicatable.

As for the Unity version... it should probably be agreed upon which one we will end up working with, as not coordinating that could be a nightmare for everyone involved. Also probably will be set on the Rollcall so no one will be confused. :D

I also personally use a LOT of fonts, because, well, for making things look cool. By all means they are NOT the final fonts, just some fun placeholders for the time being.

Hell, this repository likely isn't even where the development will be in the future.

Finally, and I'm sorry if I'm going on like a broken record here, but please read the Trello. It by all means should explain most contexts, the origins, stuff you should be looking out for, etc...

Well, barring anything I want to keep hidden for now. There's even notes on stuff to be added in subsequent updates so we can prep the infastructure for that ahead of time. It is possible to be lost, but hopefully you ask for help from your fellow team.

And.. uhh.. P.S... if you wanna know what kind of multiplayer thing I have in mind for ABS3, would be a bit of a self-hosted dedicated server thing, a bit like ZEQ2 or the SCP Containment Breach Multiplayer mod (except in SCP's case, actually good). It wouldn't be the most secure thing in the world (I would imagine), but it's a decent free solution for us, which if people want to host their servers, they can.

I included this sub-section since I knew someone would ask ahead of time, as.. it is kind of extremely important.
