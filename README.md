# anime_battle_simulator_3

Hey! If you're wondering what the heck this is, it's a basic Unity thing that may or may not be the correct Unity engine, complete with all my crappy UI assets.

It's actually been so long that I don't remember which Unity version this thing was compiled on

All models in this extremely rudimentary build, as in the game isn't even.. A GAME yet.. might not even work, or are placeholders. Ths is entirely for the ABS3 development team.
